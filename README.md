# AquaGuard
 AquaGuard uses NASA SMAP &amp; GPM satellite data combined with AI-driven insights to help farmers make smarter irrigation decisions and manage water efficiently. It also provides flood and drought alerts to support better planning and climate resilience.  It was a great experience learning, building, and collaborating through this global hackathon.
